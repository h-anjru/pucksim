function puckOverlap(infile, width)
%PUCKOVERLAP(infile, width) produces a point cloud that simulates three
%   overlapping passes by a UAS-mounted Velodyne PUCK(TM) VLP-16 Laser Scanner. 
%   The input must be the output from PUCKSIM, which is the result of simulating
%   a single pass by the UAS-mounted PUCK. The two passes will be parallel, 
%   opposite in direction, and separated by width W.
%   
%   The name of the output file from the last run of PUCKSIM in the current
%   session will be saved in the base workspace as 'simfile'.
%
%   Example:
%      % Simulate overlapping passes whose flight lines are parallel, opposite
%      % in direction, and separated by 50 m. The name of the output file from 
%      % PUCKSIM is in the workspace as 'simfile'.
%      
%      puckOverlap(simfile, 50)
%      
%      % Output saved to overlap_*.txt, where * = simfile (sans file ext.).
